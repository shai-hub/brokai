hi,
My current portfolio investment for the best profit in sale date of "Old sale date" is:

"Portfolio management"

The forcast estimate stocks table for the new sale date "New sale date":

"UpdateStocksTable"

estimate the "Maximum Stocks Invest" stocks that will make the highest profit until "new sale date"
with the closest confidence level to "Desired confidence level".
In addition, what is the desired portfolio split?
Take in count that 25 percent tax on the sale of shares in profit.
